define number of dimensional nodes per feature
define number of hidden layers and nodes per hidden layer
read row from training set
find value set for each feature
if feature value not already in list, add with random value set
perform feed forward
perform back propagation with stochastic gradient descent
update feature values by treating inputs as weights and assuming input values as 1
then use the invervse sigmoid to find the new value for the inputs


read from file in blocks
iterate through each row in a block

each layer as specific attributes
  input
    - actual value matrix
    - error matrix
  hidden
    - theta matrix
    - calculated matrix
    - activation matrix
    - error matrix
  output
    - theta matrix
    - calculated matrix
    - activation matrix
    - error matrix
